- High Availability is in [Public Preview](/temporal/release-stages#public-preview) for Temporal Cloud.

:::

Temporal Cloud's high availability Namespace feature introduces push-button multi-region availability for your Temporal Service.
This feature enables you to choose a standby region for a Temporal Namespace.
The service takes care of the complexity of replicating data from the active region to the standby region and failing over to the standby region when needed. 

- [What is a high-availability Namespace?](/cloud/high-availability#high-availability-intro)

## What is a high-availability Namespace? {#high-availability-intro}

A high-availability Namespace provides a single endpoint for a multi-region service.
This option offers a single logical Namespace that runs in two physical regions, one active and one standby.
As Workflows progress in the active region, history events are asynchronously replicated to the standby region.

In case of an incident or outage in the active region, Temporal Cloud will "failover" to the standby region.
A failover means to switch the roles of the active and standby regions.
Temporal's high-availability failovers enable existing Workflow Executions to keep running and new Executions to be initiated.

The traditional definition of active/active replication is where multiple nodes serve requests and accept writes simultaneously with strong (synchronous) data consistency.
High-availability Namespaces in Temporal Cloud allow two replicated namespaces (one active, one standby) to accept requests, but not simultaneously.
Requests are accepted, and workflow history events are written to the active region and then asynchronously replicated to the standby region.

## Why high-availability? {#why-high-availability}

For a Namespace in a single region, Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% availability and its contractual service level agreement (SLA) has a 99.9% guarantee against service errors.
For many applications, this is sufficient availability.
With this strategy, Temporal clients connect to a single Namespace in a single AWS region.
This approach works well for workloads that need the availability provided by Temporal Cloudâ€™s single-region namespaces.

High-availability supports standby recovery.
It is deployed using a simple Namespace setting.
All back-end deployment is completed by Temporal Cloud. 
In the event of a regional failure, Temporal Cloud automatically fails over to the Namespace in the secondary region.
When faced with network latency or other region-wide issues, failover can be deliberately triggered. 

High-availability advantages:

* No manual deployment or configuration needed with push button operation.
* Open workflows continue in a secondary region with minimal interruption and data loss.
* No changes required to workers and workflow starter code in setup and failover.
* 99.99% Contractual SLA.

## Understanding failover and failover scenarios {#failovers}

Consider an incident or outage that leads to elevated error rates or latency in the active region of a high-availability Namespace.
Under these circumstances, Temporal Cloud will initiate a namespace failover operation.
This operation shifts Workflow processing to a standby region, unaffected by the incident.
This allows both existing Workflows to progress and new Workflows to be created as the incident is addressed. 

Customers who wish to test the set-up of their high-availability Namespace can manually trigger failovers using the UI, API, or CLI.
For most scenarios, we recommend you let Temporal handle failovers for you.

### Replication lag {#replication-lag}

When using high-availability Namespaces, the replication between regions is asynchronous.
Any updates to the workflow in the active region, and the history events associated with it, will be applied to the standby region with a short delay.
This delay is called the replication lag.
Temporal Cloud aims to provide a P95 replication delay of less than 1 minute. 

Due to this delay, a forced failover could cause workflows to rollback in progress or cause recently started Workflows to be absent until the region recovers.
Temporal event versioning and conflict resolution mechanisms ensure that the eventual history of the Workflow is still replayable by the SDK.
Critical operations like Signals won't get lost.   

The Temporal Cloud failover mechanism chooses from several modes to execute Namespace failovers with Hybrid mode being the default.
These modes are described below.

**Forced failover** 
In this mode, a Namespace is immediately activated in the standby region.
Events not yet replicated due to replication lag will undergo conflict resolution upon reaching the new active region.
This mode prioritizes availability over consistency.

**Graceful failover (handover)**
In this mode, replication tasks are fully processed and drained.
Traffic to the Namespace is paused before the failover to ensure no loss of progress or data conflicts. 
This approach may result in a short period of unavailability with a default value of 10 seconds. 
During this period, existing Workflows will stop progress.
That means state transitions will not happen and tasks will not be dispatched.
User requests like start/signal workflow will be rejected as operations are paused during handover. 
This mode favors consistency over availability.

**Hybrid mode**
While a graceful failover is normally preferred for its consistency benefits, it is not always practical.
The hybrid failover mode (also the default) limits graceful failover attempts to 10 seconds or less.
If the graceful approach does not resolve the issue, Temporal Cloud automatically switches to a forced failover.
This strategy balances consistency and availability requirements.
