- High Availability is in [Public Preview](/temporal/release-stages#public-preview) for Temporal Cloud.

:::

Temporal Cloud's high availability Namespace feature introduces push-button multi-region availability for your Temporal Service.
This feature enables you to choose a standby region for a Temporal Namespace.
The service takes care of the complexity of replicating data from the active region to the standby region and failing over to the standby region when needed.

## What is high-availability? {#high-availability-intro}

A high-availability Namespace provides a single endpoint for a multi-region service.
This option offers a single logical Namespace that runs in two physical regions, one active and one standby.
As Workflows progress in the active region, history events are asynchronously replicated to the standby region.

In case of an incident or outage in the active region, Temporal Cloud will "failover" to the standby region.
A failover means to switch the roles of the active and standby regions.
Temporal's high-availability failovers enable existing Workflow Executions to keep running and new Executions to be initiated.

In the traditional definition of active/active replication, multiple nodes serve requests and accept writes simultaneously with strong synchronous data consistency.
High-availability Namespaces in Temporal Cloud allow two replicated namespaces (one active, one standby) to accept requests, but not simultaneously.
Requests are accepted, and Workflow history events are written to the active region and then asynchronously replicated to the standby region.

## Why choose high-availability? {#why-high-availability}

For a Namespace in a single region, Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% availability and its contractual service level agreement (SLA) has a 99.9% guarantee against service errors.
For many applications, this is sufficient availability.
With this strategy, Temporal clients connect to a single Namespace in a single AWS region.
This approach works well for workloads that need the availability provided by Temporal Cloud’s single-region namespaces.

High-availability supports standby recovery.
It is deployed using a simple Namespace setting.
All back-end deployment is completed by Temporal Cloud.

In the event of a regional failure, Temporal Cloud automatically fails over to the Namespace in the secondary region.
When faced with network latency or other region-wide issues, failover can be deliberately triggered.


High-availability advantages:

* No manual deployment or configuration needed with push button operation.
* Open workflows continue in a secondary region with minimal interruption and data loss.
* No changes required to workers and workflow starter code in setup and failover.
* 99.99% Contractual SLA.

## Understanding failover and failover scenarios {#failovers}

Consider an incident or outage that leads to elevated error rates or latency in the active region of a high-availability Namespace.
Under these circumstances, Temporal Cloud will initiate a namespace failover operation.
This operation shifts Workflow processing to a standby region, unaffected by the incident.
This allows both existing Workflows to progress and new Workflows to be created as the incident is addressed.


Customers who wish to test the set-up of their high-availability Namespace can manually trigger failovers using the UI, API, or CLI.
For most scenarios, we recommend you let Temporal handle failovers for you.

### Replication lag {#replication-lag}

When using high-availability Namespaces, the replication between regions is asynchronous.
Any updates to the workflow in the active region, and the history events associated with it, will be applied to the standby region with a short delay.
This delay is called the replication lag.
Temporal Cloud aims to provide a P95 replication delay of less than 1 minute.


Due to this delay, a [forced failover]((/cloud/high-availability#forced-failover) could cause workflows to rollback in progress or cause recently started Workflows to be absent until the region recovers.
<!--FIXME: Add link to conflict resolution converage-->
Temporal event versioning and conflict resolution mechanisms ensure that the eventual history of the Workflow is still replayable by the SDK.
Critical operations like Signals won't get lost.
  

The Temporal Cloud failover mechanism chooses from several modes to execute Namespace failovers with Hybrid mode being the default.
These modes include:

####Graceful failover (handover) {#graceful-failover}

In this mode, replication tasks are fully processed and drained.
Traffic to the Namespace is paused before the failover to ensure no loss of progress or data conflicts.

This approach may result in a short period of unavailability with a default value of 10 seconds.

During this period, existing Workflows will stop progress.
That means state transitions will not happen and tasks will not be dispatched.
User requests like start/signal workflow will be rejected as operations are paused during handover.

This mode favors consistency over availability.

####Forced failover {#forced-failover}

In this mode, a Namespace is immediately activated in the standby region.
<!--FIXME: Add link to conflict resolution converage-->
Events not yet replicated due to [replication lag](/cloud/high-availability#replication-lag) will undergo conflict resolution upon reaching the new active region.
This mode prioritizes availability over consistency.

####Hybrid failover mode {#hybrid-failover}

While graceful failovers are normally preferred for consistency, they are not always practical.
The hybrid failover mode (the default mode) limits graceful failover attempts to 10 seconds or less.
If the graceful approach does not resolve the issue, Temporal Cloud automatically switches to a forced failover.
This strategy balances consistency and availability requirements.

<!--FIXME: Add links to Triggering a failover, Worker deployment, and Routing (probably re-named?  traffic after failovers?)-->
See the sections on triggering a failover, Worker deployment, and routing for more information.

## High-availability SLA {#high-availability-sla}

High-availability Namespaces offer 99.99% availability.
This is enforced by an SLA on [service error rates](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla).
Our system is designed to limit data loss after recovery when the incident triggering the failover is resolved.

The recovery point objective ([RPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_Point_Objective)) is near-zero.
There may be a short period of time—the [replication lag](/cloud/high-availability#replication-lag)—during the incident when some data may be unavailable.
If the active region is unable to reach the standby region, the data will be unavailable until the network issue is fixed and data has finished replicating.
In a disaster scenario in which the data on the hard drives in the active region are not recoverable, the duration of data loss can be as high as the replication lag at the time of disaster.

We've designed Temporal Cloud to proactively respond to incidents by triggering failovers.
Our recovery time objective ([RTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_Time_Objective)) is 20 minutes or less per incident.
We aim to reduce this RTO in the future.

## Regional availability {#regional-availability}

High-availability namespaces are available in all existing [Temporal Cloud regions](/cloud/service-availability#regions).
