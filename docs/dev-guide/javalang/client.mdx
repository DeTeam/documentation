The Temporal Client section of the Temporal Developer's guide explains what a Client is and shows you how to configure your Java Client code to connect to the Temporal Service.

In this section you will find the following:

* [What is a Temporal Client](#what-is-a-temporal-client)
* [Types of Clients](#types-of-clients)
* [Set up a local Service Client]()
* [Configure a local Service Client to use a custom Namespace]()
* [Set up a Client to connect to a remote service]()
* [Configure a Temporal Cloud Service Client]()
* [Configure a Schedule Client]()
* [Other Java Clients]()

## What is a Temporal Client

A [Temporal Client](/concepts/temporal#temporal-client) is an SDK-supplied component that communicates with the Temporal Service.
A Temporal Client is used to start and query Workflow Executions by external processes.
Each Client wraps a "Service stub", a term unique to the Java SDK although the mechanism exists in each SDK.
A stub refers to a remote calling mechanism that allows runtime invocation using [gRPC](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-grpc-endpoint).

### What is gRPC

gRPC is a Remote Procedure Call framework developed by Google.
It features low latency and high performance.
gRPC provides Temporal with an efficient, language-agnostic communication framework.
This protocol allows the two-way communication needed to fully orchestrate Temporal applications.

Stateless communication offers advantages.
It allows for flexibility and scalability in the execution of tasks.
It also enables the Temporal Service to decompose tasks as needed, without tying those tasks to a particular Client.

### What are Service stubs

The Temporal Client communicates with the Temporal Server in a stateless manner using gRPC.
The gRPC APIs are provided by Service stubs.
A stub adds gRPC communication capabilities to the Client that wraps it. 

```java
import io.temporal.serviceclient;

// Create a stub that accesses a Temporal Service
WorkflowServiceStubs serviceStub = WorkflowServiceStubs.newServiceStubs(stubsOptions);
```

You configure stubs with a Temporal Service endpoint to connect to and other supporting options like secure connection contexts.

```java
WorkflowServiceStubsOptions stubsOptions = WorkflowServiceStubsOptions
    .newBuilder()
    .setSslContext(sslContext)
    .setTarget(gRPCEndpoint)
    .build();
```

When using Temporal Cloud, a gRPC endpoint looks like `mynamespace.myaccountidentifier.tmprl.cloud:7233`.
This endpoint includes a communication port (normally 7233), a [Namespace](/concepts/namespaces) identifier, and an [account identifier](/cloud/account-setup/namespaces#temporal-cloud-account-id).

Namespaces provides traffic isolation.
They enable you to support your development lifecycles by separating production, development, and exploratory Workflow execution.

Self-hosted endpoints will use their own naming and port schemes.

## Types of Clients

The Java SDK provides a number of Client types. 
You work almost exclusively with just two of them: the [`WorkflowClient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClient.html) and the [`ScheduleClient`](https://javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/1.23.1/io/temporal/client/schedules/ScheduleClient.html).

:::tip
A Client should be created once and persisted throughout the duration of your application process.
:::

### Workflow Client

The `WorkflowClient` is part of the `io.temporal.client` package.
A Workflow Client can start and query workflows from your code or enable other types to do the same.

```java
import io.temporal.client;

// Initialize the Temporal Client
WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(serviceStub, clientOptions);

// A WorkflowClient can establish a Workflow stub to be called at runtime
YourWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow.class, options);

// The newly created workflow stub uses Temporal orchestration to complete its work
String results = workflow.initiateWorkflow();
```

Just like a Client wraps a stub, other types can wrap Clients.

```java
// A WorkerFactory creates Workers
WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);
```

### Schedule Client

A [`ScheduleClient`](https://javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/1.23.1/io/temporal/client/schedules/ScheduleClient.html) is a specialized type of client used for operations related to scheduling.
It can create, list, and get handles to Schedules.

```java
import io.temporal.client.schedules;

// Schedule every 30 minutes
ScheduleSpec spec = ScheduleSpec.newBuilder()
    .setCronExpressions(Collections.singletonList("*/30 * * * *")).build();
Schedule schedule = Schedule.newBuilder()
    .setAction(action).setSpec(spec).build();
scheduleClient.createSchedule(scheduleName, schedule,
    ScheduleOptions.newBuilder().build());
```
