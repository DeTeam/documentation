A Temporal Workflow defines the overall flow of the application. Conceptually, a Workflow is a sequence of steps written in a general-purpose programming language.
With Temporal, those steps are defined by writing code, known as a Workflow Definition, and are carried out by running that code, which results in a Workflow Execution.

In day-to-day conversations, the term _Workflow_ might refer to [Workflow Type](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type), a [Workflow Definition](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition), or a [Workflow Execution](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution).
Temporal documentation aims to be explicit and differentiate between them.
